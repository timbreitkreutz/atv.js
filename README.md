# atv.js
Lightweight JavaScript for Rails inspired by Stimulus.js


Do you just want to have actions, targets, and values available in your Rails JS controllers? Tired of messing around with `this` and `bind` and the other bad parts of Javascript?

Do you want to not care about whether you have underscores or dashes in your Rails JS data attributes in the HTML?


If so, this library might be for you?
